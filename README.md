Classification of Blood Cell Images into Cancerous and Non-Cancerous types:


We have 10661 single blood cell images of which 7272 are non-cancerous and 3389 are cancerous. The steps we have followed for classifying the images are given below:

Preprocessing:
For preprocessing our images, we have used filters for varying saturation, contrast, brightness, sharpness etc. From all these filters, emboss filter was the most efficient one in increasing our accuracy.


# Running Models:
Ensemble Model:
For Ensemble learning, we have run 3 CNN models:
1. MobileNetV2
2. DenseNet121
3. NasNetMobile
and at last, we took 3 separate results from the 3 models and taken max voting in prediction stage.

# Concatenation Model 

It joins( concatenate ) the output of features extracted by ( output  of globalpooling layer from this two model)   MobileNET and   DenseNet121. 

This is stronger model .


# Single Model:
We ran Mobilenet as a single model.

# AutoEncoder Model:
We trained Auntoencoder and then used the encoded image for our classification.

We have initialized the layers with the pre-trained model weights but then we have learned the weights for our particular datasets for all the layers.


Result:
The Accuracies of the models implemented on our dataset are given below:

Ensemble: 75.33
Single: 80.0
Autoencoder: 81.79
